Create a simple expense tracker web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The app should allow users to log, view, edit, and delete their expenses. Use MongoDB as the database to store expense data in a collection named expenses with the following fields:

_id: Unique identifier (auto-generated by MongoDB).

amount: Number (required).

category: String (e.g., Food, Transportation, Entertainment).

date: Date (default to the current date).

description: String (optional).

The app should include the following features:

Add an expense: Users can input details like amount, category, date, and description.

View all expenses: Display a list of all expenses with their details.

Edit an expense: Allow users to update expense details.

Delete an expense: Allow users to remove an expense.

Filter expenses: Enable filtering by category or date.

Expense summary: Show a summary of total expenses and spending by category.

The user interface should be clean and simple. Use a form for adding expenses and a table to display the list of expenses. Include buttons for editing and deleting expenses. Provide a dropdown or buttons to filter expenses by category.

Color Scheme (Based on Color Theory):

Primary Color: Use a calming and trustworthy color like #4CAF50 (Green) for buttons and headers. Green symbolizes growth, stability, and positivity, which aligns with financial management.

Secondary Color: Use #2196F3 (Blue) for links and secondary actions. Blue evokes trust, professionalism, and calmness.

Background Color: Use a light neutral color like #F5F5F5 (Light Gray) for the background to reduce eye strain and create a clean, modern look.

Text Color: Use #333333 (Dark Gray) for primary text to ensure readability and contrast against the light background.

Accent Color: Use #FFC107 (Amber) for warnings or highlights (e.g., delete buttons or important notifications). Amber grabs attention without being overly aggressive.

Category Colors: Use distinct colors for expense categories to make them visually distinguishable. For example:

Food: #FF5722 (Orange)

Transportation: #3F51B5 (Indigo)

Entertainment: #E91E63 (Pink)

Utilities: #9C27B0 (Purple)

Optionally, include a chart or graph to visualize spending by category. Use the same category colors in the chart for consistency.

Provide instructions for running it locally.
